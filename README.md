# Crypto Search

## This is a mockup site of a crypto currency services site.

This is a single page application that uses the coinranking API to show data about crypto currencies. The four sections of this application are the home, market, choose us and join section.

The home section displays a title and four crypto currencies, Bitcoin, Etherium, Tether and Doge Coin.

As a highlight of the application there is the market update section, where a long list of crypto currencies are displayed and can be ordered by name, price, 24hs change and market cap ascendantly or descendantly.

The final two sections are the choose us and join sections, where the first has a number of items talking about the service and the last has buttons for the social media links.
